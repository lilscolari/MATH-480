## "Bad" Graph
This is a graph I created using traffic data from the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. I think this is an example of a "bad" graph because due to the differences in the frequencies for types of crashes, some of the histogram bars are not explanatory as their counts are not clear.

## "Good" Graph
This is an example of a "good" graph generated using [Basketball Index](https://www.bball-index.com/). I think this is a good graph because it has clear legends, shows frequencies from different areas of the court, and has a photo of the player. The color coding indicates how the player shoots relative to league average in each zone of the court. The size of the hexagons help indicate the relative volume of shots they take at different places on the court. While those exact numbers may be hidden, the graph is meant to provide insight onto where players shoot the ball the best. To make this graph better, I would add a glossary that explains what all the statistical abbreviations are.
